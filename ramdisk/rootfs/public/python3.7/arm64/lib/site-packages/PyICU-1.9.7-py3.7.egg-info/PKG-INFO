        ## Welcome
        
        Welcome to PyICU, a Python extension wrapping the ICU C++ libraries.
        
        ICU stands for "International Components for Unicode".
        These are the i18n libraries of the Unicode Consortium.
        They implement much of the Unicode Standard,
        many of its companion Unicode Technical Standards,
        and much of Unicode CLDR.
        
        The PyICU source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/ovalhub/pyicu.
        
        The ICU homepage is http://site.icu-project.org/
        
        See also the CLDR homepage at http://cldr.unicode.org/
        
        ## Building PyICU
        
        Before building PyICU the ICU libraries must be built and installed. Refer
        to each system's instructions for more information.
        
        PyICU is built with distutils or setuptools:
        
           - verify that the ``INCLUDES``, ``LFLAGS``, ``CFLAGS`` and ``LIBRARIES``
             dictionaries in ``setup.py`` contain correct values for your platform
           - ``python setup.py build``
           - ``sudo python setup.py install``
        
        
        ## Running PyICU
        
          - Mac OS X
            Make sure that ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`` contains paths to the directory(ies)
            containing the ICU libs.
        
          - Linux & Solaris
            Make sure that ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` contains paths to the directory(ies)
            containing the ICU libs or that you added the corresponding ``-rpath``
            argument to ``LFLAGS``.
        
          - Windows
            Make sure that ``PATH`` contains paths to the directory(ies)
            containing the ICU DLLs.

        ## API Documentation
        
        There is no API documentation for PyICU. The API for ICU is documented at
        http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4c/ and the following patterns can be
        used to translate from the C++ APIs to the corresponding Python APIs.
        
        ### strings
        
        The ICU string type, ``UnicodeString``, is a type pointing at a mutable
        array of ``UChar`` Unicode 16-bit wide characters. The Python unicode type
        is an immutable string of 16-bit or 32-bit wide Unicode characters.
        
        Because of these differences, ``UnicodeString`` and Python's ``unicode``
        type are not merged into the same type when crossing the C++ boundary.
        ICU APIs taking ``UnicodeString`` arguments have been overloaded to also
        accept Python str or unicode type arguments. In the case of ``str``
        objects, the ``utf-8`` encoding is assumed when converting them to
        ``UnicodeString`` objects.
        
        To convert a Python ``str`` encoded in a encoding other than ``utf-8`` to
        an ICU ``UnicodeString`` use the ``UnicodeString(str, encodingName)``
        constructor.
        
        ICU's C++ APIs accept and return ``UnicodeString`` arguments in several
        ways: by value, by pointer or by reference.
        When an ICU C++ API is documented to accept a ``UnicodeString`` reference
        parameter, it is safe to assume that there are several corresponding
        PyICU python APIs making it accessible in simpler ways:
        
        For example, the
        ``'UnicodeString &Locale::getDisplayName(UnicodeString &)'`` API,
        documented at
        http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4c/classLocale.html
        can be invoked from Python in several ways:
        
        1. The ICU way
        
                >>> from icu import UnicodeString, Locale
                >>> locale = Locale('pt_BR')
                >>> string = UnicodeString()
                >>> name = locale.getDisplayName(string)
                >>> name
                <UnicodeString: Portuguese (Brazil)>
                >>> name is string
                True                  <-- string arg was returned, modified in place
        
        2. The Python way
        
                >>> from icu import Locale
                >>> locale = Locale('pt_BR')
                >>> name = locale.getDisplayName()
                >>> name
                u'Portuguese (Brazil)'
        
            A ``UnicodeString`` object was allocated and converted to a Python
            ``unicode`` object.
        
        A UnicodeString can be coerced to a Python unicode string with Python's
        ``unicode()`` constructor. The usual ``len()``, ``str()``, comparison,
        ``[]`` and ``[:]`` operators are all available, with the additional
        twists that slicing is not read-only and that ``+=`` is also available
        since a UnicodeString is mutable. For example:
        
            >>> name = locale.getDisplayName()
            u'Portuguese (Brazil)'
            >>> name = UnicodeString(name)
            >>> name
            <UnicodeString: Portuguese (Brazil)>
            >>> unicode(name)
            u'Portuguese (Brazil)'
            >>> len(name)
            19
            >>> str(name)           <-- works when chars fit with default encoding
            'Portuguese (Brazil)'
            >>> name[3]
            u't'
            >>> name[12:18]
            <UnicodeString: Brazil>
            >>> name[12:18] = 'the country of Brasil'
            >>> name
            <UnicodeString: Portuguese (the country of Brasil)>
            >>> name += ' oh joy'
            >>> name
            <UnicodeString: Portuguese (the country of Brasil) oh joy>
        
        ### error reporting
        
        The C++ ICU library does not use C++ exceptions to report errors. ICU
        C++ APIs return errors via a ``UErrorCode`` reference argument. All such
        APIs are wrapped by Python APIs that omit this argument and throw an
        ``ICUError`` Python exception instead. The same is true for ICU APIs
        taking both a ``ParseError`` and a ``UErrorCode``, they are both to be
        omitted.
        
        For example, the ``'UnicodeString &DateFormat::format(const Formattable &,
        UnicodeString &, UErrorCode &)'`` API, documented at
        http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4c/classDateFormat.html
        is invoked from Python with:
        
            >>> from icu import DateFormat, Formattable
            >>> df = DateFormat.createInstance()
            >>> df
            <SimpleDateFormat: M/d/yy h:mm a>
            >>> f = Formattable(940284258.0, Formattable.kIsDate)
            >>> df.format(f)
            u'10/18/99 3:04 PM'
        
        Of course, the simpler ``'UnicodeString &DateFormat::format(UDate,
        UnicodeString &)'`` documented here:
        http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4c/classDateFormat.html
        can be used too:
        
            >>> from icu import DateFormat
            >>> df = DateFormat.createInstance()
            >>> df
            <SimpleDateFormat: M/d/yy h:mm a>
            >>> df.format(940284258.0)
            u'10/18/99 3:04 PM'
        
        ### dates
        
        ICU uses a double floating point type called ``UDate`` that represents the
        number of milliseconds elapsed since 1970-jan-01 UTC for dates.
        
        In Python, the value returned by the ``time`` module's ``time()``
        function is the number of seconds since 1970-jan-01 UTC. Because of this
        difference, floating point values are multiplied by 1000 when passed to
        APIs taking ``UDate`` and divided by 1000 when returned as ``UDate``.
        
        Python's ``datetime`` objects, with or without timezone information, can
        also be used with APIs taking ``UDate`` arguments. The ``datetime``
        objects get converted to ``UDate`` when crossing into the C++ layer.
        
        ### arrays
        
        Many ICU API take array arguments. A list of elements of the array
        element types is to be passed from Python.
        
        ### StringEnumeration
        
        An ICU ``StringEnumeration`` has three ``next`` methods: ``next()`` which
        returns a ``str`` objects, ``unext()`` which returns ``unicode`` objects
        and ``snext()`` which returns ``UnicodeString`` objects.
        Any of these methods can be used as an iterator, using the Python
        built-in ``iter`` function.
        
        For example, let ``e`` be a ``StringEnumeration`` instance::
        
        ```python
        [s for s in e] is a list of 'str' objects
        [s for s in iter(e.unext, None)] is a list of 'unicode' objects
        [s for s in iter(e.snext, None)] is a list of 'UnicodeString' objects
        ```
        
        ### timezones
        
        The ICU ``TimeZone`` type may be wrapped with an ``ICUtzinfo`` type for
        usage with Python's ``datetime`` type. For example::
        
        ```python
        tz = ICUtzinfo(TimeZone.createTimeZone('US/Mountain'))
        datetime.now(tz)
        ```
        
        or, even simpler::
        
        ```python
        tz = ICUtzinfo.getInstance('Pacific/Fiji')
        datetime.now(tz)
        ```
        
        To get the default time zone use::
        
        ```python
        defaultTZ = ICUtzinfo.getDefault()
        ```
        
        To get the time zone's id, use the ``tzid`` attribute or coerce the time
        zone to a string::
        
        ```python
        ICUtzinfo.getInstance('Pacific/Fiji').tzid -> 'Pacific/Fiji'
        str(ICUtzinfo.getInstance('Pacific/Fiji')) -> 'Pacific/Fiji'
        ```
